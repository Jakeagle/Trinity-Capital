A simulated banking site that users can access and use to simulate live banking with other users. 


The first upload of files (3/23/2023) is meerly a markup test. Used to test the responsiveness of the website, and to allow real users to see it in real time. Upon the site loading, you will see an alert describing what ive seen here. 

I plan to have this website fully functional, having the following features: 

Interconnectivity to users: When you create an account for this simulated bank, your data will be saved to your local computer device, allowing you to access your account whenever, and your account info remain the same. This will also allow users to interact with eachother as they use the app. 

Transfers, loans, and other money moving features: I plan on making a system where you can request loans, and money from other users, and have those funds actually be transferred using the app features. I also plan on having a payment system set up to simulate users incomes. 

Special unannounced features: Stay tuned for more.
